### App Won't Start
1. Ensure Flutter is installed: `flutter --version`

### No System Data
- App uses simulated data for demonstration
- Real hardware monitoring requires platform-specific implementation
- Battery data is real when available

### Performance Issues
1. Increase refresh rate to 2-5 seconds
2. Disable unused widgets
3. Close other resource-intensive applications

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Desktop Widget**: Use minimal mode to create a persistent desktop overlay
2. **Drag Positioning**: Position widget in corner for easy monitoring
3. **Quick Toggle**: Use expand/minimize to switch between views
4. **Settings Persist**: Your configuration is automatically saved
5. **Multiple Instances**: Run multiple widgets for different metric groups

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

### For Development
- Enable CPU and RAM monitoring
- Set 1-second refresh rate
- Use always on top feature

### For Gaming
- Monitor CPU, GPU, and Temperature
- Position widget in screen corner
- Use minimal mode to avoid distraction

### For General Use
- Enable all widgets for full overview
